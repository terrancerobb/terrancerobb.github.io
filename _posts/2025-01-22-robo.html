    <p>At Robo, a mid-sized agency, I served as the lead designer, overseeing various projects ranging from website design for clients to custom software design for internal tools and external client solutions. In addition to leading high-impact design initiatives, I mentored and advocated for two junior designers at the agency, fostering their growth and ensuring alignment with project goals. Two standout projects during my time at Robo were the Robo Dashboard and the Victory Lane Oil Change website redesign.</p>

            The Robo Dashboard was an ambitious tool intended to be part of a product suite offered to clients. The first phase focused on tracking call data from IVR systems to demonstrate the effectiveness of automated call workflows. By analyzing and visualizing this data, clients could see metrics like the percentage of users completing tasks without speaking to an agent. The dashboard was also designed to scale, with functionality planned for possible future features such as client communications, document signing, and revenue tracking.

      <h2>Outcomes and Impact</h2>
      <h3>Robo Dashboard</h3>
      <p>
        Although the project was in its early stages and to my knowledge has not yet launched, the design work established a strong foundation for showcasing data, comparisons, and trends. This provided clients with insights into Robo's effectiveness and created a framework for future enhancements. The dashboard's scalable design set the stage for additional functionality, ensuring it could grow with evolving business needs.
      </p>

      <h3>Victory Lane Website</h3>
      <p>
        The redesigned website improved usability and presented a modern, professional brand image for Victory Lane Oil Change. Enhanced navigation, reduced clutter, and clear calls to action helped streamline the customer journey, providing a better experience for visitors and supporting Victory Lane's business goals.

      <h2>Reflections</h2>
  <p>
    My time at Robo reinforced the value of leadership in design, particularly the impact of mentoring and advocating for junior designers. The Robo Dashboard taught me how to approach early-stage product design with flexibility and foresight, while the Victory Lane project highlighted the importance of collaborative client relationships and iterative design processes. These experiences deepened my ability to create scalable, user-centered solutions while fostering a supportive and productive team environment.

          A client website design I created. There was little-to-no branding guidance, and this was a bit of a greenfield design - still based on the client's content strategy.
