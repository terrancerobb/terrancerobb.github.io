      <p class="tr-720w tr-720w--left">Rocket Mortgage, developed by Quicken Loans, is an online platform that revolutionizes the mortgage process by making it accessible and easy to navigate. As a UI/UX Designer, I worked on various projects within the platform, including internal tools, vendor integrations, and end-user-facing experiences. My role focused on simplifying complex workflows and creating user-centered interfaces that align with business goals.</p>

      <h2 class="tr-720w tr-720w--left">Problem Statement</h2>
      <p class="tr-720w tr-720w--left">The mortgage process is inherently complex and overwhelming for many users, especially those unfamiliar with financial jargon or digital tools. The challenge was to design a platform that simplifies this process, reduces friction, and provides clarity while ensuring a seamless user experience for a diverse audience with varying levels of technical proficiency. There was also a heavy focus on the implementation of a rebrand.</p>

        <h3>Research and Insights</h3>
        <p>
          To address user pain points, I conducted stakeholder interviews, reviewed user data, and collaborated with product strategists to identify key challenges in the mortgage application journey. These insights helped shape our design priorities, focusing on simplifying complex processes and addressing usability gaps.
