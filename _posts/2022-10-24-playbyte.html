    <h2 class="tr-720w tr-720w--left">My Work with Playbyte</h2>
    <p class="tr-720w tr-720w--left">Playbyte operates in the startup space, and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/playbytes-new-app-aims-to-become-the-tiktok-for-games/">featured in TechCrunch</a> and referred to as the "TikTok for games". During my time working with the company, the mission was to update their application and help them shift toward a more advanced platform for creating full-fledged games on your phone that was also simple and clear to use.</p>

    <p class="tr-720w tr-720w--left">I spent time diving into visual coding, social features, and conceptualizing an experience that game designers and engineers alike would find both valuable and enjoyable. The sands shifted over time regarding the target demographic, from the general public to more serious current and would-be indie game creators, and this change may be evident throughout some of the following design examples. The following work includes samples from an iterative design process, so you may also notice inconsistencies across features and visuals. The company has since pivoted into a more game-development-focused solution.</p>
