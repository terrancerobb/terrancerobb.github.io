<p class="tr-960w">Everdays is a mobile and web app that connects the families and loved ones of someone who has passed away. My time working with Everdays was spent as the startup's primary UI designer.</p>

<p class="tr-960w">Alongside executive and business leaders, marketing and creative, and the dedicated developers for each platform, I designed and helped implement UIs for native iOS and Android apps, web apps (consumer and b2b), as well as developing a visual language, styleguide, and icon set to be used across all platforms.


  I took part in whiteboarding sessions and design work including sketches, wireframes, prototypes, and full-fidelity mockups.</p>
