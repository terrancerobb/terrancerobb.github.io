    <h2 class="tr-720w tr-720w--left">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="tr-720w tr-720w--left">Everdays is a mobile and web app designed to connect families and loved ones following the passing of an individual. As the startupâ€™s primary UI designer, I collaborated with executive leaders, marketing teams, and developers to create intuitive user interfaces for native iOS and Android apps, as well as consumer- and business-facing web apps. I also developed a cohesive visual language, style guide, and custom icon set, ensuring a seamless and consistent experience across all platforms.</p>

    <h2 class="tr-720w tr-720w--left">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p class="tr-720w tr-720w--left">The key challenge was designing a platform that catered to a demographic often composed of older individuals who might be unfamiliar with modern technology. The interface needed to balance simplicity and clarity, offering a familiar and inviting experience while providing robust tools to facilitate communication during emotionally challenging times.</p>

        <h3>Research and Insights</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure the platform met the needs of its target demographic, I focused on understanding the preferences and challenges of older & tech-averse users. By analyzing software popular with this audience and consulting with internal stakeholders, I identified key usability features, such as simplified navigation, larger touch targets, and clear visual hierarchies. This foundational research informed every design decision, ensuring that the app was both approachable and effective for users of all experience levels.

        </figure>
        <p>
          The invite page, acting as the primary interface users see when visiting shared links, needed to convey a significant amount of information in an organized and accessible way. By simplifying content presentation, establishing clear visual hierarchies, and unifying tasks into guided flows, I created a set of experiences that felt intuitive while maintaining functionality.

      </figure>
      <p>
        With the advent of COVID-19, facilitating remote connections became vital. I designed the video sharing feature from the ground up to make it easy for users to post, view, and interact with content in a way that felt familiar, drawing inspiration from social platforms.

    <p>
      Addressing a common scenario where users had access to a decedent's phone, I developed a secure, step-by-step guide for importing contacts. This solution streamlined sharing profiles with relevant contacts directly, while ensuring the process was straightforward and respectful of privacy.

    I established a unified visual style across all Everdays platforms, from mobile apps to business dashboards. Through a comprehensive style guide and close collaboration with developers, I ensured consistency in design and branding, enhancing the user experience at every touchpoint.

      <h2>Outcomes and Impact</h2>
      <p>
        The design solutions I implemented contributed to a more accessible and cohesive user experience across Everdays' platforms. By focusing on the unique needs of the app's demographic, the platform facilitated meaningful communication among families during difficult times. User feedback and insight from the customer success team over time ensured that our efforts were effective. Additionally, I maintained close relationships with implementation teams along the way, ensuring consistency and quality across the board.

      <h2>Reflections</h2>
  <p>
    This project underscored the importance of empathy and user-centered design, especially when addressing sensitive topics. The experience honed my ability to design for diverse user groups and balance functionality with accessibility. Collaborating with a multidisciplinary team on a product with such emotional significance was both challenging and deeply rewarding.
